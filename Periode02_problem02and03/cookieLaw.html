What does "strictly necessary" mean?

This has not been clearly defined in the legislation, however most guidance suggests that it should be interpreted in a very narrow sense.

The example most often given is that cookies used to enable someone to buy something from an online store are 'strictly necessary' and therefore don't require consent - it is implied by the request from the user to process their order.

However cookies that help to give a personalised experience, or enable you to gather visitor data about site visits, are not 'strictly necessary', even if they are very useful.

A very useful source of guidance on this topic is an opinion produced by the Article 29 Working Party - a leading EU body.
